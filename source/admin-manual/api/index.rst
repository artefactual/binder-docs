REST API
========

The Binder user interface is largely written in JavaScript (primarily
`AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`__ 1.2), running in the
browser. The JavaScript then makes requests to REST APIs to create, read,
update, and delete data.

Below you'll find documentation for and example usages of the available endpoints:
