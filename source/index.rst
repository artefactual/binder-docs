Binder is an open source digital repository management application designed to
meet the needs and complex digital preservation requirements of cultural
heritage institutions. Binder was created by
`Artefactual Systems <http://www.artefactual.com/>`__ and the
`Museum of Modern Art <http://www.moma.org/>`__.

Binder aims to facilitate digital collections care, management, and
preservation for time-based media and born-digital works, and is built
from integrating functionality of the Archivematica_ and AtoM_ projects.

A presentation on Binder's functionality, given at AMIA 2014, can be viewed
`online <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPebm5nh83o>`__ (note that Binder
was initially called the DRMC).

Slides from a presentation at the Code4LibBC 2014 conference can also be viewed
