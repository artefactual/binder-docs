Binder is an open source digital repository designed to meet the needs and
complex digital preservation requirements of cultural heritage institutions.
Binder was created by `Artefactual Systems <http://www.artefactual.com/>`__ and
the `Museum of Modern Art <http://www.moma.org/>`__.

Binder aims to facilitate digital collections care, management, and
preservation for time-based media and born-digital works, and is built
from integrating functionality of the Archivematica_ and AtoM_ projects.

A presentation on Binder's functionality, given at AMIA 2014, can be viewed
`online <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPebm5nh83o>`__ (note that Binder
was initially called the DRMC).
