Binder is an open-source, web-based digital repository management application.
It is designed to support the care, management, and preservation of complex
entities such as time-based media and born-digital works. Binder provides
users with a central interface in which to view and manage relationships
between the components of a work, related preservation objects (AIPs), the
digital objects and technical metadata related AIPs contain, as well as the
supporting technologies required to preserve and display the works over the
long-term. The goal of Binder is to gather together all the information
required to make long-term preservation and assessment decisions in a single
user-friendly interface.

Binder integrates and enhances functionality from two existing open source
preservation and access applications:

* Archivematica_, an open-source digital preservation system taht is designed
  to maintain standards-based, long-term access to collections of digital objects
* AtoM_ (Access to Memory), an open-source, web-based application for
  standards-based description and access

Binder has also been integrated with The Museum System
(`TMS <http://www.gallerysystems.com/tms>`__), and can pull in
artwork metadata via the TMS API developed by Steve Moore and the Museum of
Modern Art (https://github.com/smoore4moma/TmsApi).

What can you do with Binder?
============================

Binder brings together descriptive, technical, preservation, and
administrative metadata about a work, its components, related AIPs and the
digital objects they contain, and the supporting technologies used to preserve
and display them. Binder’s modules are designed to give you the management
information you need in a single place to make decisions and implement
policies supporting long-term preservation and access.

**With Binder you can:**

* Import AIPs and reference copies of digital objects from Archivematica, and
  relate them to descriptive metadata imported from TMS or created in Binder.
* Gain at-a-glance collection-wide statistics about fixity, ingest, and use via
  the widget-based dashboard.
* Relate the components of a work to derived AIPs and any supporting
  technologies required to preserve and display them in the future, using a
  node-based graphical user interface.
* View and download an AIP’s digital objects and technical metadata.
* Sort search and browse results based on facets drawn from both descriptive and
  technical metadata, allowing for a high degree of precision and granularity -
  and then save your search parameters for future re-use.
* Run and manage fixity checks of preserved AIPs, and receive alerts if a fixity
  check fails.
* Track who downloads digital objects from your repository, and why.
* Compare the descriptive and technical metadata of up to 4 digital objects from
  an AIP side by side in a graphical user interface.
* Generate and save reports on ingest, fixity, usage, and more.

Why Binder?
===========

**n. Something that produces or promotes cohesion in loosely assembled substances**

* n. A chemical that causes two substances to bond into one
* n. A cover or holder for unbound papers, pages, etc
* n. A plant whose growth habits prevent erosion
* n. A software mechanism that performs binding (e.g. data binding)
* n. One who binds.
