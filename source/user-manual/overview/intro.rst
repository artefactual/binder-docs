Binder is an open-source web application for managing digital repositories.
Binder is particularly adept at supporting the care, management, and
preservation of complex digital collections such as time-based media and born-
digital artworks. The app provides users with a central interface through
which they can  access, view and manage the rich technical metadata contained
in Archival Information Packages (AIPs) held by the repository, as well as
managing and describing the relationships between the components of a
collections object, its constituent digital objects, and the various external
dependencies required to preserve and display the collection over the long-term.
Binder gathers together all of this information required to make long-term
preservation and assessment decisions in a single user-friendly interface.

Binder integrates and enhances functionality from two existing open source
preservation and access applications:

* Archivematica_, an open-source digital preservation system taht is designed
  to maintain standards-based, long-term access to collections of digital objects
* AtoM_ (Access to Memory), an open-source, web-based application for
  standards-based description and access

Binder has also been integrated with The Museum System (TMS_), and can pull in
artwork metadata via the TMS API developed by Steve Moore at the Museum of
Modern Art (https://github.com/smoore4moma/TmsApi).

.. _why-binder:

Why Binder?
===========

**n. Something that produces or promotes cohesion in loosely assembled substances**

* n. A chemical that causes two substances to bond into one
* n. A cover or holder for unbound papers, pages, etc
* n. A plant whose growth habits prevent erosion
* n. A software mechanism that performs binding (e.g. data binding)
* n. One who binds.

What can you do with Binder?
============================

Binder aims to support standards-based digital repository management by
providing users with a single place to view administrative, technical,
descriptive, and preservation metadata related to objects in a repository and
the relationships between them. This in turn gives repository managers the
information they need to craft appropriate preservation policies and implement
decisions for long-term care.

Binder’s user-friendly graphical interface provides useful information about
your collection, its components, and the supporting technologies required to
preserve and display objects held in the repository. The widget-based
dashboard includes at-a-glance collection, ingest, download, and fixity
information, while the reports module gives administrators detailed
information that can be downloaded in CSV format, or viewed directly in the
application. The graph-based context browser included on artwork record pages
allows users to visualize the components of a work, and manage relationships
between a work’s components, its AIPs and the files they contain, and related
supporting technologies (such as codecs, operating systems, etc) required for
ongoing preservation and access. The digital object viewer includes technical
metadata extracted from the METS file generated by Archivematica_, a copy of
the DIP for easy visual reference, and the ability to download files directly
or the entire AIP.

**With Binder you can:**

* Import AIPs and reference copies of digital objects from Archivematica, and
  relate them to descriptive metadata imported from TMS or created in Binder.
* Gain at-a-glance collection-wide statistics about fixity, ingest, and use via
  the widget-based dashboard.
* Relate the components of a work to derived AIPs and any supporting
  technologies required to preserve and display them in the future, using a
  node-based graphical user interface.
* View and download an AIP’s digital objects and technical metadata.
* Sort search and browse results based on facets drawn from both descriptive and
  technical metadata, allowing for a high degree of precision and granularity -
  and then save your search parameters for future re-use.
* Run and manage fixity checks of preserved AIPs, and receive alerts if a fixity
  check fails.
* Track who downloads digital objects from your repository, and why.
* Compare the descriptive and technical metadata of up to 4 digital objects from
  an AIP side by side in a graphical user interface.
* Generate and save reports on ingest, fixity, usage, and more.
